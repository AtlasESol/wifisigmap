Stage: Alpha
Development Items Todo
	- UI to mark AP locations
		- Future idea: Calculate location of APs based on intersection of circles:

			http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Circle-CircleIntersection.html
			http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/38925/least-squares-intersection-of-three-circles
			http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5760582/how-to-define-the-intersection-of-three-circles
	- Code and UI to save/load "map"
		- Map composed of:
			- Map file (store bitmap in file?)
			- AP locations
			- Signal readings
				- WiFi readings at each point
	- Actual code to interface UI with WifiDataCollector
	- UI to for user to change color of the AP signal
	- UI for user to remove signal reading/get info (e.g. popup of AP essid, etc)
	- UI to browse for BG image
		- Future idea:
			- Specify scale, e.g. if bg image is from google maps, etc.
	- Test build an Android version

Later:
	- Possible idea if needed/demand:
		- UI/code to provide a URL for a bg image and download URL for use as bg
	
	
Android TODO:
	- Test with map
	#- Fix rendering of markerGroups
	- New dialog to prompt to choose AP in "mark AP" mode (ok button too far off right of screen)
	- Move buttons for "load/save/bg" to a popup menu
	- Elimate scrollbars on QGraphicsView
	- Need better integration with native theme on Android (e.g. buttons don't look right)
	- Need new filebrowser dialog (current one is next to useless)
	- Definetly need to be able to move items and update map rendering (.e.g to fine-tune position of APs)
	- Need zoom+/- buttons (think overlay on Google My Tracks - plus/minus buttons that come on bottom when touched and fade out after a few seconds)
	- Since necessitas conolse isn't giving qDebug() output, create simple qDebug hook to xmit debug messages over the wire
	- Added a "spinner" around the fingertip during longpress to show action
	- Add a spinner during calls to WifiDataCollector::scanWifi() since the 1sec hard delay has been added on android
	- Draw grid numbers in default background
