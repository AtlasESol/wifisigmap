Stage: Beta

Core Items TODO:
	- UI to for user to change color of the AP signal
	- UI for user to remove signal reading/get info (e.g. popup of AP essid, etc)
	- UI to browse for BG image
		- Future idea:
			- Specify scale, e.g. if bg image is from google maps, etc.
	- Add dialog to enable/disable rendering of APs (MapApInfo::renderOnMap)
	- Need to be able to move items and update map rendering (.e.g to fine-tune position of APs)

	#- Offer to NOT render circle (or delay rendering) during scan
		- For now, added #ifndef Q_OS_ANDROID - TODO make it configurable
	- NEED TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE MARKERS
	
Enhancements:
	- Add RSSI sparkline to HUD next to each AP (or behind/over the AP text to save space) 
	- Add FTP upload/download "feature" to upload/download backgrounds/wmz files for "cloud" storage
		- Example C++ code:
			QUrl uploadurl("ftp://ftp.drivehq.com/wwwhome/"); 
			uploadurl.setUserName("XXXXXX"); 
			uploadurl.setPassword("XXXXXX"); 
			uploadurl.setPort(21); 
			QNetworkRequest upload(uploadurl); 
			QNetworkAccessManager *uploadman = new QNetworkAccessManager(this); 
			uploadman->put(upload, file);
	- Add code to lookup mfg of AP based on MAC OUI.
		- Example Perl code:
			my $oui_cmd = "wget http://iphone.aruljohn.com/mac/mac.pl?mac=$mac -O - 2>/dev/null";
			my $oui_raw = `$oui_cmd`;
			my ($mfg) = $oui_raw =~ /<h2>(.*?)<\/h2>/i;
	- Add "instant mark" (no longpress)


Android TODO:
	- New dialog to prompt to choose AP in "mark AP" mode (ok button too far off right of screen)
	- Move buttons for "load/save/bg" to a popup menu
	- Need better integration with native theme on Android (e.g. buttons don't look right)
	- Need new filebrowser dialog (current one is next to useless)
	- Need zoom+/- buttons (think overlay on Google My Tracks - plus/minus buttons that come on bottom when touched and fade out after a few seconds)
	- Dont cancel spin if move within +/- X pixels
		- MUST have to use app on Kindle because Kindle Fire touch screen is VERY sensitive (won't hold still so it invalidates the longpress timer)

Later:
	- Possible idea if needed/demand:
		- UI/code to provide a URL for a bg image and download URL for use as bg
	
Idea:
	- Create AP location calculator as well
	- Change rendering of user location marker to a live painter (so we're not doing QPixmap::fromImage() eveyr call)
 
Location Notes:
	- Calculate location of APs based on intersection of circles:

		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5760582/how-to-define-the-intersection-of-three-circles
	- Use Kalman filtering to smooth results

Research Notes:
	- Test bilinear/bicubic interpolation
		- one example: http://cboard.cprogramming.com/game-programming/87890-bilinear-interpolation.html
		- wikipedia:
			- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicubic_interpolation
	- Use Kalman filter on dBm values
	- Use window average function on dBms
	- Setup quantifiable testing methodology to test accuracy of various methods
	- Use bilinear interpolation to convert dBms to distances...?
	- Test an ANN on dBm to distances?
