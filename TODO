Stage: Alpha
Development Items Todo
	#- UI to mark AP locations
		x- Future idea: Calculate location of APs based on intersection of circles:

			http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Circle-CircleIntersection.html
			http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/38925/least-squares-intersection-of-three-circles
			http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5760582/how-to-define-the-intersection-of-three-circles
	#- Code and UI to save/load "map"
		- Map composed of:
			- Map file (store bitmap in file?)
			- AP locations
			- Signal readings
				- WiFi readings at each point
	#- Actual code to interface UI with WifiDataCollector
	- UI to for user to change color of the AP signal
	- UI for user to remove signal reading/get info (e.g. popup of AP essid, etc)
	- UI to browse for BG image
		- Future idea:
			- Specify scale, e.g. if bg image is from google maps, etc.
	#- Test build an Android version

Later:
	- Possible idea if needed/demand:
		- UI/code to provide a URL for a bg image and download URL for use as bg
	
Bugs and Minor Items not specific to Android:
	- Definetly need to be able to move items and update map rendering (.e.g to fine-tune position of APs)
	- Draw grid numbers in default background
	#- Fix positions of markers - positions dont zoom promperly (shift during zoom)

	
Android TODO:
	#- Test with map
	#- Fix rendering of markerGroups
	- New dialog to prompt to choose AP in "mark AP" mode (ok button too far off right of screen)
	- Move buttons for "load/save/bg" to a popup menu
	#- Elimate scrollbars on QGraphicsView
	- Need better integration with native theme on Android (e.g. buttons don't look right)
	- Need new filebrowser dialog (current one is next to useless)
	- Need zoom+/- buttons (think overlay on Google My Tracks - plus/minus buttons that come on bottom when touched and fade out after a few seconds)
	#- Since necessitas conolse isn't giving qDebug() output, create simple qDebug hook to xmit debug messages over the wire
	- Added a "spinner" around the fingertip during longpress to show action
	#- Add a spinner during calls to WifiDataCollector::scanWifi() since the 1sec hard delay has been added on android
		Invalid, moved scannign to scan thread
	
	
Ease of use items:
	# - Attempt rescan if no APs found (configurable from menu)
	#- Offer to NOT render circle (or delay rendering) during scan
		- For now, added #ifndef Q_OS_ANDROID - TODO make it configurable
	# - Update status when "rendering" so user can move
	# - Place temp marker during scanning at location
		- NA, changed scan mode
	- NEED TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE MARKERS
	- Fingertip spinner would be nice
	- Dont cancel spin if move within +/- X pixels
	# - ERROR if can't save due to permissions
	- Add dialog to enable/disable rendering of APs (MapApInfo::renderOnMap)
	- Make another render mode (multiple ellipse at each level - part way between circles mode and radial lines)
	- Move radial line render (and others?) to a "live paint" item - so zooming in renders the lines cleanly (idea: use QPicture?)
	
Idea:
	- Factor in more than two APs 
	- Use live data captured (pci4000-live.wmz) to test user locating
		- Idea: Train an ANN?
		- Idea: Somehow account for non-linear dBm/levels to distance/angel
	- Create AP location calculator as well
 	- Change rendering of user location marker to a live painter (so we're not doing QPixmap::fromImage() eveyr call)
