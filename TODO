Stage: Alpha
Development Items Todo
	- UI to mark AP locations
		- Future idea: Calculate location of APs based on intersection of circles:

			http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Circle-CircleIntersection.html
			http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/38925/least-squares-intersection-of-three-circles
			http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5760582/how-to-define-the-intersection-of-three-circles
	- Code and UI to save/load "map"
		- Map composed of:
			- Map file (store bitmap in file?)
			- AP locations
			- Signal readings
				- WiFi readings at each point
	- Actual code to interface UI with WifiDataCollector
	- UI to for user to change color of the AP signal
	- UI for user to remove signal reading/get info (e.g. popup of AP essid, etc)
	- Test build an Android version
